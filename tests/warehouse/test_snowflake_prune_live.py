"""Gated live materialised-sample prune e2e against a real Snowflake (#139 US-004).

This is the **live certification for the projection-subquery sample shape** —
the #139 fix for Snowflake's ``HASH(*)``-in-predicate rejection. The offline
``fakesnow`` / ``sqlglot`` suite (``tests/prune/test_compiler_fakesnow.py``,
``tests/warehouse/test_snowflake_adapter_fakesnow.py``) pins the compiled
Snowflake SQL's *shape* and ``sqlglot`` parse-validity, but neither certifies
that a **real** Snowflake accepts the new sample SQL: ``fakesnow``'s DuckDB
backend cannot execute the variadic ``HASH(*)``, and ``sqlglot`` parses the
*old* (invalid) inline form without complaint. Only a live run certifies the
projection-subquery shape — create an engineered writable table, run a
hand-crafted candidate test against it under
``prune.scope: sample`` + ``prune.sample_strategy: materialised`` (which
exercises ``materialise_sample``'s ``CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE … AS SELECT * EXCLUDE
(_sf_sample_hash) FROM (SELECT t.*, ABS(HASH(*)) AS _sf_sample_hash …)`` CTAS),
and watch the engine drop a ``not_null`` over a guaranteed-non-null column as
``always-passes``.

Before #139, ``materialised`` sample-mode emitted ``MOD(ABS(HASH(*)), n)`` in
WHERE / ORDER BY, which Snowflake rejects (``002079``: ``HASH(*)`` is valid only
in the SELECT projection); that bug (bead ``bd_1-scaffolding-cdp``) is fixed by
the projection-subquery shape + ``render_sample_select``. (The ``oneshot`` sample path —
which routes the sample row-count through the vendor-neutral
``WarehouseAdapter.get_row_count`` seam introduced by issue #140, bead
``bd_1-scaffolding-tft`` — is certified by the second test in this module,
``test_prune_drops_always_passes_not_null_live_oneshot_sample``.) This module
is the belt-and-suspenders half
— a ``@pytest.mark.snowflake``-gated test that drives a **real**
:class:`SnowflakeAdapter` through :func:`signalforge.prune.prune_tests` end to
end against a live warehouse and asserts the v0.1 differentiator (Architectural
Commitment #1: an always-pass test is dropped, not shipped).

**DEC-004 — RESOLVED in favour of the PRIMARY form (live-certified 2026-05-27).**
The emitted SQL uses the primary form: ``ORDER BY _sf_sample_hash`` at the outer
level where ``_sf_sample_hash`` is ``SELECT * EXCLUDE``-d from the output
projection. The open question — whether Snowflake accepts ``ORDER BY <col>`` when
that column is ``SELECT * EXCLUDE``-d — was answered by this test's live run:
Snowflake **accepts** it, so the primary form ships and the shipped fixtures
stand. The documented fallback (drop the outer ``ORDER BY`` in
``render_sample_select`` + the fixtures, leaning on the deterministic ``MOD``
filter alone, matching the prune compiler CTE which emits no ``ORDER BY``) was
therefore **not** needed; it remains on record only as the contingency had live
rejected the primary form.

NO LLM, NO ``generate`` CLI: this test builds the :class:`Model`,
:class:`Manifest`, the :class:`CandidateSchema` (one
:class:`CandidateTestNotNull`), and the :class:`PruneConfig` in-process and calls
:func:`prune_tests` directly. ``prune_tests`` owns the ``with adapter:`` block
itself (it prunes and closes the session), so the prune adapter
is NOT pre-entered here; a *separate* short-lived adapter does the engineered
table setup and the ``DROP TABLE`` teardown.

Belt-and-suspenders gating (``.claude/rules/testing-signal.md`` § "End-to-end
gated tests"):

1. ``@pytest.mark.snowflake`` — registered in ``pyproject.toml``
   ``[tool.pytest.ini_options].markers`` and deselected by the default
   ``addopts`` (``-m '... and not snowflake'``), so the default ``pytest`` run
   never collects this test.
2. A runtime :func:`_skip_reason` — when a maintainer runs ``pytest -m
   snowflake`` but lacks credentials, each missing prerequisite surfaces as a
   distinct skip-with-reason rather than a confusing connection error.

Required env vars (each missing one yields its own distinct skip reason):

* ``SF_RUN_SNOWFLAKE=1`` — the project-wide opt-in for "this test talks to a
  real warehouse" (mirrors ``SF_RUN_BQ=1`` for the BigQuery e2e; accepts
  ``1``/``true``/``yes``/``on``).
* ``SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`` / ``SNOWFLAKE_USER`` / ``SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`` — the
  minimal password-auth connection triple.
* ``SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE`` — compute context for the engineered ``CREATE TABLE``,
  the materialised-sample ``CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE … AS SELECT`` CTAS, and the
  per-test ``COUNT(*)``.
* ``SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`` + ``SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA`` — the **WRITABLE** target where
  the engineered table is created. The read-only ``SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA`` share
  cannot accept a ``CREATE TABLE``, so a writable namespace is required; the
  table is dropped in teardown.

**Cost guidance — set a Snowflake resource monitor FIRST.** Before running,
create a resource monitor with a hard credit cap so a runaway query cannot bill
unbounded credits. Use an **XS (extra-small) warehouse** with **aggressive
auto-suspend** (e.g. 60 seconds) so the compute idles down immediately after the
run. The engineered table is a handful of rows, so the per-test ``COUNT(*)``
is tiny; the dominant cost is warehouse
spin-up — an XS warehouse with fast auto-suspend keeps a single run well under a
cent.

Run via the maintainer-only invocation (``--no-cov`` because
``--cov-fail-under`` in ``addopts`` would fail a marker-specific run that
exercises only a fraction of the codebase)::

    export SF_RUN_SNOWFLAKE=1
    export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=<org-account>
    export SNOWFLAKE_USER=<user>
    export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=<password>
    export SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=<xs-warehouse>
    export SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=<writable-database>
    export SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=<writable-schema>
    uv run pytest -m snowflake --no-cov

Engineered determinism (``.claude/rules/testing-signal.md`` § "Engineered
determinism"): the assertion does NOT depend on any LLM output — the candidate
test is hand-crafted. The engineered table's ``region`` column is the literal
``'austin'`` on every row, so a ``not_null`` test over it returns zero failing
rows on any sample → the prune engine routes it to ``always-passes`` (drop)
mathematically, not probabilistically.

Traces to: #139 US-004 (live certification of the projection-subquery sample
shape via materialised sample-mode prune); originally #124 US-004 (warehouse +
prune-only gated live e2e, then pinned to ``scope=full``).

       ``decision == "dropped"`` with ``reason == "always-passes"`` — the v0.1
       differentiator (Architectural Commitment #1).
    5. Tears the engineered table down with ``DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`` in a
