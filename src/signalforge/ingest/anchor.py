"""Anchor-contract validator for the ingest layer (US-004).

Verifies that every column and test in a built
:class:`signalforge.draft.models.CandidateSchema` references a column that
actually exists on the target ``Model`` (the caller supplies that column
set as a ``frozenset[str]`` — typically ``frozenset(model.columns.keys())``).

DEC-002: a test referencing a column absent from the ``Model`` means the
ingested YAML is stale or wrong vs. the manifest. This is a correctness
error the operator must fix — fail loud. Distinct from *unsupported test
types*, which are skip+record (DEC-003).

DEC-007: the check is re-implemented in-layer rather than importing
``signalforge.draft.parser._validate_anchor_contract``. That validator
raises the LLM-typed :class:`LLMOutputAnchorContractError`, which would
surface an LLM-taxonomy error from a non-LLM path and create a cross-layer
``ingest → draft`` import. The body is small (set-membership + per-test
checks); duplication is cheaper than the taxonomy smell. The phrasing
mirrors the drafter's validator so the two read consistently.

Whole-file fail-loud: the validator collects **every** violation rather
than short-circuiting on the first, so the operator can fix the schema in
a single pass. A clean candidate raises nothing.

This module emits **no logging** (manifest-readers.md rule #4 — reader /
parser modules are deterministic and stay silent; observability lives in
the consuming prune / grade stages).

    """Verify ``candidate`` references only columns present on the model.

    Walks the candidate schema collecting every anchor-contract violation
    (never short-circuits on the first). Raises one
    :class:`IngestAnchorContractError` whose ``violations`` tuple lists all
    of them when any exist; returns ``None`` when the candidate is clean.

    Checks performed:

    * Each :class:`signalforge.draft.models.CandidateColumn` name must
      reference a real column in ``model_columns``.
    * Each per-column test must carry ``test.column == column.name`` (a
      column-scoped test citing a different column would land under the
      wrong YAML key).
    * Each per-column test's ``column`` must reference a real column in
      ``model_columns``.
    * Each model-level test's ``column`` must reference a real column in
      ``model_columns``. Model-level-only variants (``row_count_between``
      — issue #169; ``unique_combination`` — issue #170) whose Pydantic
      model fixes ``column = None`` are exempt from this check — ``None``
      is the canonical model-level shape, not a missing column reference.
